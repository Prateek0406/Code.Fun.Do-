Rapid Rescue

We are building a software solution for people stuck in debris during disasters like earthquakes, landslides, avalanches etc.
Most people stuck in rubble are alive with no injuries at all to major and injuries requiring immediate attention. People die because the search and rescue teams aren`t able to locate them in time.
We have a software solution for that. We are making an application that can sense that you`re stuck in debris and enables your phone to start the necessary disaster management procedures.
We will have a centralized server that will scrap the internet continuously to detect (using ML,NLP) if a disaster has occurred and find all the relevant information such as location, area, severity and type of disaster has occurred. Depending on the information the server sends a notification to all the users in the affected area .
There may be a case, that the user is stuck in a collapsed building which has collapsed not because of a natural disaster but poor construction. In this case, since there may not be immediate news about the incident. The server may not detect the disaster. So, the application will allow some authorized users (friends/family/people decided by the user) to send a manual notification of the disaster to the application. So, that the application can start its disaster management procedures. 

Disaster management procedure:
1-	Confirming if a person is stuck in a disaster: - First it will send a text notification asking the users if they are stuck in debris. If the there is no response from the user within 60 sec, it will ask a the same question in full volume and the user will be able to give voice response. This is to enable users to respond in case they are injured and/or are not in a position to physical reach their cell phone. If still there is no response, the program will assume that the user is indeed in a danger and is unconscious, so immediate actions is needed.
Depending upon on which phase does the user respond or doesn`t respond (last case), severity is decided.
The next six steps are taken only if the program decides that the user is stuck in a disaster.

2-	Now, the phone is unlocked and ready to work on voice commands. User can access internet, ask time etc., location services are switched on.
3-	It sends and saves its current location using GPS to the central server.
4-	Friends and family are informed via text message.
5-	Automatically calls emergency services.
6-	Ring siren on full volume when the phone detects search team is near. It can use Bluetooth/Wi-Fi/Proximity sensor in order to achieve that.
7-	People stuck in such situations are in a grave danger of hopelessness, depression and anxiety because of darkness and loneliness. So, we propose to integrate a voice enables chat bot in the app. Your phone, even if not connected to the internet, will work as a much-needed companion in this situation.
We propose to add a feature to allow the data collected by smart watch to be sent to the server. It can help with remote medical diagnosis.
